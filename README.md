## Guideline:
Chose a dataset and adopt a significance level alfa equal to 0.05
1) Perform and comment the univariate analysis for each covariate.
2) Estimate a multivariate Cox regression model.
3) Comment the obtained results.
4) Report the estimates of the hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence
interval for the complete model.
5) Use a backward selection procedure for model of point 2 if necessary.
6) Check if model of point 5 satisfy PH assumption.
7) Estimate a model with time varying coefficient for variable/s (if present) that
violate PH.
8) Test linearity for continuous variables.
9) Chose the “best” parametric model for the data and describe the shape of the
hazard function
